# check-pass-test-app

Create a Java program that opens the file data.txt (which is assumed to be placed in the same folder as this program). Look for the text "FINISHED" in data.txt. If such as text exists then count the number of occurrences of "TEST PASS" in the same file and report this number to the user. If "FINISHED" does not exist then the program should warn and stop.
